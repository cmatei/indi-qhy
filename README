Temporary home for INDI (http://indilib.org) drivers for QHY astronomical cameras.


QHY9 Current Status
-------------------

What works:

- getting images at bin 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 
- temperature control. The regulator itself is crappy (oscillates), but will 
  do for +/- 0.5 degrees.
- CFW control
- controlling the shutter to shoot darks
- readout speed, gain, offset etc are configurable
- subframes [*]

What doesn't work:

* I hopefully leave something uninitialized, somewhere after the subframes commit.
  Last nights at the scope I had an issue, namely that first exposure would hang and
  require a camera reset. Once working, it was reliable.
  I'm hoping it's a software issue, rather than broken hw.
