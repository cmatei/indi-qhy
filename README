QHY9 Current Status
-------------------

What works:

- getting images at bin 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 
- temperature control. The regulator itself is crappy (oscillates), but will 
  do for +/- 0.5 degrees.
- CFW control
- controlling the shutter to shoot darks
- readout speed, gain, offset etc are configurable

What doesn't work:

- subframes
